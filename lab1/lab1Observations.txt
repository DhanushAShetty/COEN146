COEN 146 Lab 1 notes

Step 3
./Lab1_s1e caused a segmentation fault (core dumped)

Step 4
./Lab1_s1e 3000 creates child and parent process with a delay of 3000 microseconds
./Lab1_s1e 500 does the same but with a shorter delay of 500 microseconds
./Lab1_s1e 5000 also creates child and parent processes but with a longer delay of 5000 microseconds

Step 5 - used pthread_create instead of fork
gcc -pthread -o Lab1_s5e Lab1_s5.c
./Lab1_s5e 3000
./Lab1_s5e 500
./Lab1_s5e 5000
